# Extracting Complex Information from Natural Language Text
Information Extraction is the art of extracting structured information from natural language text, and it has come a long way in recent years. Many systems focus on binary relationships between two entities -- a subject and an object. However, most natural language text contains complex information such as beliefs, causality, anteriority, or relationships that span several sentences.  
# Repository
In this project,  we focus on 5 systems that have particular provisions for dealing with more than triples:  FRED, K-Parser, ClausIE, MinIE , and OpenIE.  
* The test_sentences file : contains 3-5 test sentences for each of our dimensions of complex knowledge.  
* The results file: includes the screenshots of the outputs of each system tested on our set of sentences.
